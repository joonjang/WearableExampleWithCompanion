FAQ:

When you run the Android app you run into this excpetion:
```
ITouchExplorationStateChangeListenerImplementor due to MAX_PATH: System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException: Could not find a part of the path
```
The filepath to the solution is too long, relocate the repo.

"Should I be able to test and debug it on emulators"
I used a physical phone and watch to test and debug as I couldn't get the watch emulator paired with the Android companion app


"It gives me Segmentation Fault exception when I try to connect to the service but maybe this is expected"
What I did to overcome that issue was by using the device logs and Console.WriteLine to see if my functions were entering and exiting correctly.


"Iâ€™m stuck with inability to use my watch with the debugger. The watch is connected to the network"
Did you create a certificate for the watch? Visual Studio has a toolbar menu that links to the Tizen Certificate Manager program but it does nothing. The bug is that they used the wrong application. 
Go to: .tizen\tizenSDK\tools\certificate-manager
"certificate-manager.exe" is the bug, the real program is "eclipse.exe"
